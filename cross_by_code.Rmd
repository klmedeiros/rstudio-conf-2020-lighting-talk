### cross_by_periods()

# of questions in weeks, months:
```{r}
questions %>% 
  cross_by_periods(c("week", "month")) %>% 
  summarize(nb_questions = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(date))
```

Rolling 28-day # of questions:
```{r}
questions %>% 
  cross_by_periods(windows = c(28)) %>% 
  summarize(nb_questions = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(date))
```

### cross_by_dimensions()
```{r}
questions %>% 
  cross_by_dimensions(tag) %>% 
  summarize(nb_questions = n())
```

but to really wow them, combine the two!
```{r}
questions %>% 
  cross_by_periods("week") %>% 
  cross_by_dimensions(tag) %>% 
  summarize(nb_questions = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(date)) %>% 
  head(20)
```
